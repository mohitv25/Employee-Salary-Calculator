# Employee-Salary-Calculator
Employee salary calculator implemented using java and OOPs concepts This mainly employs the concepts inheritance in OOPs. Here the employee details such as name , age, salary or hours worked depending on the user are taken as input. If the employee is salaried then their annual salary is generated as output. If the employee is hourly employed, then the program asks for the total hours worked, based on this it generates the output that is the annual salary. This is a really basic mini project using java along with the OOPs concepts. feel free to pull and edit the code as per requirement!!
